// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
// or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
// compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
